national statistical systems in five key areas, called pillars. The five pillars are:\nData Use: Statistics have value only if they are used. So the first pillar is data use. A successful statistical system produces data that are used widely and frequently.\nData Services: A range of services connects data users to producers and facilitate dialogues between them, thus building trust and a sense of value.\nData Products: The dialogues between users and producers drive the design and range of statistical products and their accuracy, timeliness, frequency, comparability, and levels of disaggregation. The products signal whether countries are able to produce indicators related to the 17 Sustainable Development Goals.\nData Sources: To create useful products, the statistical system needs to draw on sources inside and outside the government. Data collection thus goes beyond the typical censuses and surveys to include administrative and geospatial data as well as data generated by private firms and citizens.\nData Infrastructure: A mature statistical system has well-developed hard infrastructure (legislation, governance, standards) and soft infrastructure (skills, partnerships) as well as the financial resources to deliver useful—and widely used—data products and services.\nEach of these pillars is supported by four or five dimensions and uses defined methods and indicators, all available as open data and open code. You can explore the data or learn more about the framework."

The goal is to improve development outcomes and track progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals.\nThe hope is that the SPI framework will give countries incentives to build better statistical systems and will help create data ecosystems that can develop and adapt to the requirements of governments and citizens - so that better data can support better decisions.\nThis is the Country Report for Albania based on data from 2022.\n Download the SPI data \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSPI overall scores provide an overall summary of the performance of statistical system.
