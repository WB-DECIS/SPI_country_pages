    "text": "The SPI framework assesses the maturity and performance of national statistical systems\nReliable, usable, high-quality statistics are vital for global prosperity and progress. The Statistical Performance Indicators (SPI) provide an open-source framework for assessing the performance of statistical systems and the efforts to improve them. This page provides detailed country reports for the SPI. Click to visit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWelcome to the Statistical Performance Indicators (SPI) country pages. The SPI framework assesses the maturity and performance of national statistical systems.\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to View All Country Pages\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items\n\n\n\n\n\nThe SPI framework assesses the maturity and performance of national statistical systems in five key areas, called pillars. The five pillars are:\nData Use: Statistics have value only if they are used. So the first pillar is data use. A successful statistical system produces data that are used widely and frequently.\nData Services: A range of services connects data users to producers and facilitate dialogues between them, thus building trust and a sense of value.\nData Products: The dialogues between users and producers drive the design and range of statistical products and their accuracy, timeliness, frequency, comparability, and levels of disaggregation. The products signal whether countries are able to produce indicators related to the 17 Sustainable Development Goals.\nData Sources: To create useful products, the statistical system needs to draw on sources inside and outside the government. Data collection thus goes beyond the typical censuses and surveys to include administrative and geospatial data as well as data generated by private firms and citizens.\nData Infrastructure: A mature statistical system has well-developed hard infrastructure (legislation, governance, standards) and soft infrastructure (skills, partnerships) as well as the financial resources to deliver useful—and widely used—data products and services.\nEach of these pillars is supported by four or five dimensions and uses defined methods and indicators, all available as open data and open code. You can explore the data or learn more about the framework."

It provides stakeholders—from policymakers to stock market analysts and the public—with the latest data on the country’s socioeconomic developments. Since quality statistics are essential for evidence-based policymaking, assessing and improving the capacity of countries’ statistical systems has long been a part of the global agenda. In addition, monitoring progress on global initiatives, such as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), requires high-quality data that must be produced in a consistent and comparable manner across different national statistical systems."

    "text": "What is the difference between the SPI and its predecessor, the Statistical Capacity Index?\nNational statistical systems (NSS) have advanced their data collection and dissemination practices, and the Sustainable Development Goals have set an ambitious development agenda to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure prosperity for all by 2030. This, in turn, has increased the demand for data and has raised the bar for national statistical systems to produce high-quality statistics. The SPI aims to improve on the Statistical Capacity Index (SCI) to better reflect the changing global data landscape.\nThe SCI, first produced in 2004, provided data on 146 economies; the SPI covers 174 economies, with data on selected indicators available for 217 economies. The SPI framework covers several of the same topics as the SCI, such as statistical methodology, data, and periodicity, but expands into new areas as well. The SCI relied on fewer information sources and did not include indicators from labor force surveys, establishment surveys, or administrative data. It also did not assess data dissemination practices or data use. The SCI was primarily focused on statistical output and activities and did not consider the infrastructure and financing of statistical systems, nor did it assess whether data users consider NSS products useful.\nThe SPI framework aims to do all these things—and more. It uses 51 indicators to assess performance organized according to five pillars: data use, data services, data products, data sources, and data infrastructure. It benefits from large scale data collection efforts by organizations such as the World Bank, IMF, Open Data Watch, PARIS21, the ILO, WHO, UNESCO, IHSN, and the UN, among others.\nPlease see the technical note for more details."

The scores for each pillar are calculated using the scores for the underlying dimensions, which in turn are derived from the values of their indicators. The overall SPI score is an average of the scores for the five pillars.\nPillars 1, 2, 4, and 5 take the unweighted averages of their underlying dimensions. Pillar 3 (which relies on the UN Global SDG monitoring database) takes a weighted average of its own four dimensions, with weights based on the number of SDGs in each dimension. The detailed methodology is available here.\nFor the overall score countries can achieve a maximum of 100 and a minimum of 0. A score of 100 would indicate that a country has every single element that the SPI measures in place, and a score of 0 that none are in place.\nThe SPI is designed to treat all five dimensions as equally important. However, users can customize the weights here and see the impact on the overall score. The list of indicators is here."

A successful statistical system produces data that are used widely and frequently.\n\n\n\n\nData Services: A range of services connects data users to producers and facilitate dialogues between them, thus building trust and adding value to data..\n\n\n\n\nData Products: The feedback systems between data producers and data users drive the design and help increase the range of statistical products available, and can help improve their accuracy, timeliness, frequency, comparability, and levels of disaggregation. The availability and quality of key NSS data products signal whether countries can produce indicators needed to measure progress toward the 17 Sustainable Development Goals.\n\n\n\n\nData Sources: To create useful products, a statistical system needs to draw on sources inside and outside the government. Modern data collection thus goes beyond the typical censuses and surveys to include administrative and geospatial data, as well as data generated by private firms and citizens.\n\n\n\n\nData Infrastructure: A mature statistical system has well-developed institutional infrastructure (legislation, governance, standards), soft infrastructure (skills, partnerships), and the financial resources to deliver useful—and widely used—data products and services.\nUnderpinning these five pillars are 22 dimensions and 51 indicators.

The availability and quality of key NSS data products signal whether countries can produce indicators needed to measure progress toward the 17 Sustainable Development Goals.\n\n\n\n\nData Sources: To create useful products, a statistical system needs to draw on sources inside and outside the government. Modern data collection thus goes beyond the typical censuses and surveys to include administrative and geospatial data, as well as data generated by private firms and citizens.\n\n\n\n\nData Infrastructure: A mature statistical system has well-developed institutional infrastructure (legislation, governance, standards), soft infrastructure (skills, partnerships), and the financial resources to deliver useful—and widely used—data products and services.\nUnderpinning these five pillars are 22 dimensions and 51 indicators.
